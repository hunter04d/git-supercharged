# Git supercharged

A zero to hero guide to git.\
It can be used as an introductory to the git, however such experience is not recommended.\
I have also found it to be a decent git reference sometimes.

**Actual slides can be found [here](https://hunter04d.github.io/git-supercharged).**

The [whattodo.md](https://github.com/hunter04d/git-supercharged/blob/master/whattodo.md) explains what was showcased in each demo.\
The repositories in the demos are in the "pre demo" state.\
If you want to. You can go through the steps in the [whattodo.md](https://github.com/hunter04d/git-supercharged/blob/master/whattodo.md) to see if you can go through the\
demos to see what they do.

The actual demos are located in the zip archive "demos.zip" that can be found in this repository.
