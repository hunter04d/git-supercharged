# Git supercharged

A zero to hero guide to git.\
It can be used as an introductory to the git, however such experience is not recommended.\
I have also found it to be a decent git reference sometimes.

**Actual slides can be found [here](https://hunter04d.github.io/git-supercharged).**\
alternately you can use the direct link [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AtvU5fqqrj57gQbJWwizr_w5gVfO).

The [whattodo.md](whattodo.md) explains what was showcased in each demo.\
The repositories in the demos are in the "pre demo" state.

If you want to: go through the steps in the [whattodo.md](whattodo.md) to see if you can do the things\
done in the demos and see what they do.

The actual demos are located in the zip archive "[demos.zip](demos.zip)" that can be found in this repository.
